A mod for Project Zomboid, allowing players to spend skill points on positive traits after 
character creation, and removal of negative traits.

Traits that are mutually exclusive of a trait the player has already can not be bought (ie:
a player with Slow Reader must spend points to remove it before he/she can get Fast Reader)

By default, the cost in skill points is x4 what the cost is on the character creation screen.
